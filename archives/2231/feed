And as you can see in MSDN, WinAPI supports huge amount of possibilities to replace C++ std. libs. And your binary will have a great portability, because in Windows we have variety of msvcr*.dll&#039;s, so with WinAPI you can avoid this &quot;DLL Hell&quot;]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I hope the people who left bad comments regarding this tutorial doesn&#039;t get to you, because we would love to see more of your tutorials. I will try this tutorial in due time, and I understand that we might not use it IRL but people, or at least me, wants to know how things work.

Thanks!]]></description>
