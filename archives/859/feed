		<description><![CDATA[The way I solved this is very similar to your solution #3, except I changed the OR EAX, EAX to CMP EAX, EAX. I like the XOR EAX, EAX though. It never occurred to me that it would force the register to be 0. Thanks for the tutorials; they&#039;re great!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First , let me say that you should probably post on the forum as a lot more people will read your questions and you&#039;ll get answers faster, but that being said...

NOPing the push will probably crash, depending on what&#039;s on the stack as the function call will POP these arguments off, but since you have not pushed the 0x0C argument, it will pull the next thing off the stack- probably the return address. As soon as you hit a RETN statement, you will be off to la la land.

You could set the 0x0C value to 0xFE, which will raise it to 255 digits, but there is nothing you could put in to give an infinite amount.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[About the Count parameter = C (12.) in GetDlgItemTextA (PUSH 0C)... what if we nop it? Do we cause any implication in the function? Is there a value so we can set C (12) to infinite?]]></description>
