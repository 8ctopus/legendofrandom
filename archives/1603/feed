		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;m using Olly 2.0 and the string that you reference with the message that says something like &quot;you have X amount of tries left&quot; does not show up in the referenced string search list for me. I can see the registry string you mentioned just fine but not this one :( Why might this be?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Interesting :)

According to a quick check I&#039;ve done the checks at 405B08 seems like return value checks (error handling). However 405AA5 is much more interesting. 0x140 seems like the magic value which will be placed after successful registration. The registration validation happens around 406FE2 and by nopping 406FEE I was able to register my software with your magic numbers 12121212.

Thanks again for the great job.]]></description>
