		<description><![CDATA[Thanks for all these tutorials, they are great, I&#039;ve learned a lot already and just can&#039;t get enough ^^

Btw. If someone missed that... The password comparison is at 0040111D and the password itself is 43 (33 34 &lt;-HEX &amp; Little Endian = Swap = 34 33) if we want to do this without patching.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey! I&#039;m the one writing tutorials around here!


but, yes, that would work. I guess I was kind of thinking a lot of cool stuff could also be added like if you started typing the ascii code, the window would jump to that entry, and maybe the header would stay on the top of the screen instead of scrolling off. You know- dream world stuff.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[You can open the AsciiTable DLL in resource hacker, go to Dialog -&gt; 101 -&gt; 1037 and then and ES_READONLY to the ES_* parameters inside the control. 

For resizable window it&#039;s a bit trickier, but you could and WS_THICKFRAME to the line starting with STYLE and then add WS_THICKFRAME again to the CONTROL to make the outer and inner frames resizable. I&#039;m sure there&#039;s an option to make the inner frame auto-maximizing depending on the parent, but you can probably figure out that by yourself :)]]></description>
