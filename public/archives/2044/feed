		<description><![CDATA[In so many ways, I am more more offended by the “generic commenter” than I am 
by the more obvious spammer.  You may ask 
why Because at least the obvious spammer is completely open and honest about their spamming!
I know who they are. The so called generic commenter is a cheat and a faker!
You can probably notice that I have strong feelings towards these 
type of spammers

		<description><![CDATA[Hi R4ndom... using win7 64bit with olly 1.10 can&#039;t trap the memory bp, using olly 2.01 can&#039;t conditional log bp since right click on names didn&#039;t show it.
Can we do point H on win7 64bit?]]></description>

I could not find the P32Dasm file included in the zip for this tutorial nor on the tools page. Of course I found it easily with a simple web search but I just wanted to let you know that it is not included with the tutorial files as indicated. Thank you so much for the tutorials and I am excited and looking forward to learning more about RE!!]]></description>
