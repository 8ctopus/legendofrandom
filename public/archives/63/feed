		<description><![CDATA[i have run into problems with trace on Random&#039;s version. (cant use the original as it doesnt seem to work with the program). Now the Trace is missing what is going on in the program, unless if i step through the commands. the original olly does work ok.

And the trace Protocol options are missing. The closest in random&#039;s is &quot;set condition&quot; menu item (condition to pause run trace) however these settings dont appear to do what the &quot;set protocol&quot; menu item (commands protocolled by run trace) did, which was ignore everything outside the specified range. so this is making things more difficult.

		<description><![CDATA[nvm
i found the tutorial on olly&#039;s site.. a little unintuitive though... &quot;run trace&quot; gives one output and so i thought that was the function of &quot;trace&quot;, but &quot;trace into&quot;/over&quot; gives what was needed.

		<description><![CDATA[Hi,
since i dont see what i want in the things above i ask if perhaps there is a plug in to do this.

I notice &quot;hit trace&quot; has been removed in this cooler version of olly you distribute in Tutorial3. is there a way to limit the hit trace hilight to the previous 100 or so lines in the program? (for times that it decides to suddenly close) .. or perhaps even remember the program paremeters from 100 lines ago and simply revert to when it was back...


Or perhaps hilight a new command or jump that did not occur/run in the previous execution of the program or perhaps stop the first line that hasnt been run before in the currently running code?
