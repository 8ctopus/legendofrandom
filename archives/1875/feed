		<description><![CDATA[Hello, I was just wondering how to make a patch like this one below...

&quot;IDM v6.xx.release.5-patch&quot; (find in google)

What it does is search &amp; replace (SNR) but the thing about
this particular patch is...

It offers to add a &quot;First and last Name&quot; to the the .exe
file in question leaving the product registered to any
individual.

How can we add this &quot;add name&quot; feature in dup2...?

Can anyone help...]]></description>
