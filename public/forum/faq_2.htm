			<h2>Login and Registration Issues</h2>
			
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r0"><strong>Why can’t I login?</strong></dt>
					<dd>There are several reasons why this could occur. First, ensure your username and password are correct. If they are, contact the board owner to make sure you haven’t been banned. It is also possible the website owner has a configuration error on their end, and they would need to fix it.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r1"><strong>Why do I need to register at all?</strong></dt>
					<dd>You may not have to, it is up to the administrator of the board as to whether you need to register in order to post messages. However; registration will give you access to additional features not available to guest users such as definable avatar images, private messaging, emailing of fellow users, usergroup subscription, etc. It only takes a few moments to register so it is recommended you do so.</dd>
					<dd><a href="faq_2.htm#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r2"><strong>Why do I get logged off automatically?</strong></dt>
					<dd>If you do not check the <em>Log me in automatically</em> box when you login, the board will only keep you logged in for a preset time. This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in, check the box during login. This is not recommended if you access the board from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university computer lab, etc. If you do not see this checkbox, it means the board administrator has disabled this feature.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r3"><strong>How do I prevent my username appearing in the online user listings?</strong></dt>
					<dd>Within your User Control Panel, under “Board preferences”, you will find the option <em>Hide your online status</em>. Enable this option with <samp>Yes</samp> and you will only appear to the administrators, moderators and yourself. You will be counted as a hidden user.</dd>
					<dd><a href="faq_2.htm#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r4"><strong>I’ve lost my password!</strong></dt>
					<dd>Don’t panic! While your password cannot be retrieved, it can easily be reset. Visit the login page and click <em>I’ve forgotten my password</em>. Follow the instructions and you should be able to log in again shortly.</dd>

				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r5"><strong>I registered but cannot login!</strong></dt>
					<dd>First, check your username and password. If they are correct, then one of two things may have happened. If COPPA support is enabled and you specified being under 13 years old during registration, you will have to follow the instructions you received. Some boards will also require new registrations to be activated, either by yourself or by an administrator before you can logon; this information was present during registration. If you were sent an e-mail, follow the instructions. If you did not receive an e-mail, you may have provided an incorrect e-mail address or the e-mail may have been picked up by a spam filer. If you are sure the e-mail address you provided is correct, try contacting an administrator.</dd>

				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r6"><strong>I registered in the past but cannot login any more?!</strong></dt>
					<dd>It is possible an administrator has deactivated or deleted your account for some reason. Also, many boards periodically remove users who have not posted for a long time to reduce the size of the database. If this has happened, try registering again and being more involved in discussions.</dd>
					<dd><a href="faq_2.htm#faqlinks" class="top2">Top</a></dd>
				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r7"><strong>What is COPPA?</strong></dt>
					<dd>COPPA, or the Child Online Privacy and Protection Act of 1998, is a law in the United States requiring websites which can potentially collect information from minors under the age of 13 to have written parental consent or some other method of legal guardian acknowledgment, allowing the collection of personally identifiable information from a minor under the age of 13. If you are unsure if this applies to you as someone trying to register or to the website you are trying to register on, contact legal counsel for assistance. Please note that the phpBB Group cannot provide legal advice and is not a point of contact for legal concerns of any kind, except as outlined below.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r8"><strong>Why can’t I register?</strong></dt>
					<dd>It is possible the website owner has banned your IP address or disallowed the username you are attempting to register. The website owner could have also disabled registration to prevent new visitors from signing up. Contact a board administrator for assistance.</dd>

				</dl>
				<hr class="dashed" />
				<dl class="faq">
					<dt id="f0r9"><strong>What does the “Delete all board cookies” do?</strong></dt>
					<dd>“Delete all board cookies” deletes the cookies created by phpBB which keep you authenticated and logged into the board. It also provides functions such as read tracking if they have been enabled by the board owner. If you are having login or logout problems, deleting board cookies may help.</dd>

					<dd>There are two images which may appear along with a username when viewing posts. One of them may be an image associated with your rank, generally in the form of stars, blocks or dots, indicating how many posts you have made or your status on the board. Another, usually a larger image, is known as an avatar and is generally unique or personal to each user. It is up to the board administrator to enable avatars and to choose the way in which avatars can be made available. If you are unable to use avatars, contact a board administrator and ask them for their reasons.</dd>

In general, you cannot directly change the wording of any board ranks as they are set by the board administrator. Please do not abuse the board by posting unnecessarily just to increase your rank. Most boards will not tolerate this and the moderator or administrator will simply lower your post count.</dd>

BBCode itself is similar in style to HTML, but tags are enclosed in square brackets [ and ] rather than &lt; and &gt;.
