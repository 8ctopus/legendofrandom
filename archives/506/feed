		<description><![CDATA[Hi,

there is problem with this crackme, or tutorial, because you wrote:
&quot;Set another breakpoint on the JE instruction and re-start (or run) the app. Click on “Help”-&gt;”Register” in the crackme program, enter a username and a serial, and click OK.&quot;

And according your tutorial:
&quot;Woah! Wait a second! We got the bad boy message and Olly never broke? That means Olly never reached our breakpoint! What is going on here.&quot;

But in my case, program stoped at BP at JE (addres: 00401243). Am I missing something?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I think you missed out a step at the end where you patch the JE instruction. It sounds like you&#039;re saying that we somehow need to patch the flags register so that the Z flag is modified every time the program is run:

&quot;Now the problem is that since we changed the flag on the fly, when the app is run again it will not change that flag again, so we will get the bad message. What we need to do is somehow save that change so that every time the program is run, we can force it to make that jump. This is where patching comes in.&quot;]]></description>
