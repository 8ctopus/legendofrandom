		<description><![CDATA[Very good tutorial.  If you dont mind, i think the right title would be adding a message box to executable.  The splash screen basically means an image in the jpg, png, gif or any other format.  Keep up your good work.

		<description><![CDATA[Another good one. Finally back here and going to go through all your tuts. It would be nice if you showed how to edit the entrance pointer in the hex dump (Does OllyDBG have a PE header decoding plugin?)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[ooooooohhhhhhhh. I get it now. The code section is still usually read only. This is why Olly makes you re-save the changes you&#039;ve made to a binary.

		<description><![CDATA[Sorry for the lame wording.

The point is that many articles states that .code section is read-only. But when your are using code cave you are actually writing new code into .code section. So my assumption was that this section is not (always) read-only.]]></description>
