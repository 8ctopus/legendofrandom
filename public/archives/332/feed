		<description><![CDATA[It&#039;s an inspiring work. I&#039;m a man from least background of computer science and assembly language. Even though your demonstrations are really working because of it&#039;s clarity. That&#039;s because you&#039;ve an overall vision to guide beginners in the world of reverse engineering. Hey one personal request: where can I get get your ollydbg.exe that shows red arrows for jumps. I desperately need it. I feel it as the most convenient way to visualize jumps.  olly, the one I&#039;m working with is from your zipped archive downloaded from tutorial 3 package. Help me..]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Thank you for a very well written tutorial.
Moving from a different debugger and into Olly was very challenging but you SIR made the transition enjoyable.
Thank you,

		<description><![CDATA[Just for the record I find all of your tutorials hilarious and well done. If you wrote a book I&#039;d buy it in a heartbeat (unless it doesn&#039;t have sarcasm and smiley faces then I&#039;ll have none of it!).]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Again thank you for the tutorial.  I like the little homework section that has us expand on what we&#039;ve learned in this tutorial as well as previous ones.  A great example to start off for those of us who are new to this.]]></description>
