		<description><![CDATA[I dont understand the serial check routine after the serial you entered goes into &quot;keygenning&quot; routine you arrive at one point where the real check is done:

XOR [ARG.2],1337C0DE
SUB [ARG.2],BADC0DE5
MOV EAX,[LOCAL.1]
NOT [ARG.2]
XOR EAX,[ARG.2]
NEG EAX
SBB EAX,EAX
INC EAX

I dont understand the &quot;check&quot; that is going on here,the C flag get set here but i am missing the whole picture,any clue?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great piece of work and knowledge, big thanks for that. You write so clear and straightforward, keep going.

Unfortunately canyou.dll treated as trojan - 10 / 41 at virustotal.com]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Because of the nature of some of the apps and crackmes in this series&#039; nature, false positives show up from time to time. The best way to see if it&#039;s a false positive is to go to www.virustotal.com and upload the file. It will scan the file using 42 different virus scanners. If you only get 3 or four hits, you know it&#039;s nothing. More than 7- I would stay away from.

If you downloaded the files from me, you do not need to worry about them- all of mine were scanned with VirusTotal before I even did the tutorials.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I&#039;ve been really enjoying these tutorials. I went through 3- 7 today already, and I&#039;ll probably do 8 and 9 as well...
One issue:
Avg detects crackme8 as the virus Win32/Heri . Is it a false positive, or is it possible that the crackme creator is malicious. Thank R4ndom!]]></description>
