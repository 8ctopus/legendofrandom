		<description><![CDATA[I have been waiting for a TCG like this for a long time and the best part 
is that it will be completely free-to-play when it is released.
He became my Big Brother and would come and take me to different places or just to his house to be with his family.
I would like to make it clear that I am not out 
to save-the-world. He jumped up and snatched me 
down from a fence I was trying to escape over. After taking him what 
he wanted, he asked what was I doing, saying nothing, he asked if I wanted to hang out with him; I &quot;hung out&quot; for four years, he had finally gotten what he wanted.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great introduction to what I am sure will be a great series in Ollydbg and RCE.  I&#039;m looking at your tutorials as well as Lena151.

Could you comment on why assembly language appears to have a lot of disorder to its structure (i.e. jumps after jumps and calls after calls)?  Why can&#039;t it follow the simple hierarchical structure higher level programming such as C, C++, Java, etc uses?

Thanks in advance for the reply!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Heya! I know this is somewhat off-topic however 
I had to ask. Does running a well-established website such as yours require a massive amount work?

I am completely new to writing a blog but I do write in my journal everyday.
I&#039;d like to start a blog so I will be able to share my own experience and thoughts online. Please let me know if you have any ideas or tips for brand new aspiring blog owners. Appreciate it!]]></description>
