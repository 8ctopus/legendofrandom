MOV EDX, [EBP + 0x0C]
ESP is the top most stack value right?
then what is EBP?
18F9c0 - 18F9D4 = 0x0E?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Instead of searching the web for opcodes, you can get Olly to do the work for you. Just go to line 401407, right click -&gt; binary -&gt;  edit and enter 52 90, Olly will automatically show you the assembly code. 

Also, anyone try running this on win7x64? I think it is throwing an error when the app tries to change data in the code segment.

Thanks r4ndom! I&#039;m learning a lot with these tutorials.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[There are two ways to figure out the length of an instruction; In you assembly book, there will be a section that displays the opcodes to each instruction, along with the length.

You can also do what I did, try them in Olly and see how long they are when you patch the code :)]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Wow awesome, FRIGGIN LOVE IT!
This is the best tutorial EVER, love all those stuff and the best part is I guess what to do before I actually read it, feels good!

One thing though:
Can we know the size of an instruction beforehand? like for example we didn&#039;t do mov edx, dword ptr [address of &quot;error occured&quot;]. Instead, we did mov edx, [ebp+0c].. I mean how did you know (besides trying of course and noticing that the first one overwrites code we need) the size of our instruction?

Thanks, really!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Indeed this tutorial was very helpful in shedding light on a multiple of aspects regarding RCE. But I must say &#039;the solution&#039; itself felt rather unreliable and reminded me of - I wouldn&#039;t go as far as saying &#039;pure&#039;, but - &#039;good&#039; luck.

As such, based on your experience, Random, are &#039;solutions&#039; of this kind plenty or closer to &#039;a one of a kind&#039; trick?
