		<description><![CDATA[Nevermind. Since I have a little experience reversing, I was skipping through sections of the tutorials and didn&#039;t realize you were using the MnemonicHelp plugin. Also since I&#039;m running Win7 I wasn&#039;t able to read the old help file until I downloaded the Winhlp application from microsoft. Anyway, like I said before, I love your site and tutorials, thanks for everything!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[First of all your tutorials are awesome, thanks for everything.  I was wondering where you acquired your &quot;intel x86 instructions&quot; reference. Could you provide a link, or maybe add it to your downloads section? I can&#039;t seem to find it anywhere. Anyway, thanks for all the information, it&#039;s been really helpful.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Where it says: &quot;Ok, let’s study this a little. We see a jump leads to this message from 402C56, denoted by the red arrow.&quot;

Should the address be: 4025C6? Just wondering I know it&#039;s trivial but it could confuse beginners like me.

Thanks!]]></description>
