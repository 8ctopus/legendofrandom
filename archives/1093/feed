		<description><![CDATA[I encountered &quot;Exception 000006BA - Exception is non-continuable&quot; exception while running WinRAR with OllyDbg v2.01 (beta 2). 
This exception does not appear when I use R4ndom&#039;s OllyDbg.
Does anyone know how to solve this problem?]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[R4ndom,

I have done all of the tutorials up to and including this one. I just want to let you know how much I appreciate the time that you obviously gave toward creating these tutorials for others. I feel like I have already learned from you as much as I would only have learned from years of experience on my own. I would totally hug you br0mance-style irl, man. 

This was my favorite tutorial so far because I feel that it gave me the opportunity to test my new skills in a practical way as opposed to just trying them on applications that are specifically designed toward our purposes. I look forward to continuing through the rest of them when I get breaks from projects/studying

Thanks again!!]]></description>

Did you forget to include you needed a plugin because you use it so much that you forgot it was a plugin :P ?]]></description>
