		<description><![CDATA[R4ndom, I&#039;m struck at initial stage of the 3rd level. With GetDlgItemTextA password was stored at.0040305D. When I check the register EAX it doesn&#039;t show me that it holds .0040305d, instead it has the number .0040300F(ASCII access granted). I&#039;ve entered the same serial (12121212) as yours for further check. I&#039;m unable to move forward now. Please help me.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Does the solution of the password is reversing the assembly cmp dx, 42de by setting the value dx = 42de and reversing the structure of the assembly code,like dl=42 and dh=de and so on. I&#039;m a beginner on this that&#039;s y i ask. Thanks random.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hey R4ndom,

This is definitely one of the best series I&#039;ve read on the subject. I&#039;m learning so much with this incremental approach.

Fuck though, I just spent hours trying to reverse-engineer the algorithm to see if I can generate the password. Unfortunately, it took me that long to realize that you can&#039;t actually reverse an AND operation (because bit information is lost).

I suppose that, since you can reverse an XOR operation with another XOR operation, you will be able to recreate most of the password (everything except password[0], password[4] and the final two characters that are used to store the &quot;checksums&quot;). Still, you&#039;ll have an enormous amount of possible passes to try. It&#039;s not the full range of all possible characters (62 ** 10 in total), but I really don&#039;t feel like coding something like that.

Thanks again though!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Hi R4ndom,

First of all thanks for yours awesome tutorials.
I&#039; ve just start to study this now, I&#039;m kind of lost in this tutorial, how to really change the code to jump all the check instructions. What I did it was change 2 lines of the original code.

0040143E                JNZ SHORT Crackme6.0040142D
00401440               XOR ECX,ECX


I changed for:
0040143E      XOR EAX,EAX
00401440      JMP 00401515

Now my code is always jumping to end of the function. But I would like to know if is this correct? Or anybody could help me out with this.

Thanks guys.]]></description>
