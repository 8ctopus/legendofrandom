# The Legend of Random

This is static copy of The Legend of Random as it was on Thu, 19 Sep 2013. Some of the links are not functional.

The Legend Of Random was a wordpress blog by `R4ndom`, a hacker and reverse engineer who shares his insights, challenges, tools and tutorials.

## why a static copy?

The site's wordpress got infected with malware at some point then the original author abandonned the project and the project was lost.

## notes

The site code is a big mess because of wordpress and because of the infection. Cleanup pull requests welcome. Please make atomic changes and separate pull requests.
