		<description><![CDATA[Very interesting, I have a question (as usual). For the code here:
reason==DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH

Would there be a way to make this reason be the event within the &#039;host&#039; program. For instance, if the program does some action such as make a popup, could we set the &quot;reason&quot; to be the popup action - and then set the code to simply close the window or suppress it?]]></description>
