# The Legend of Random

This is static copy of The Legend of Random as it was on Thu, 19 Sep 2013. Some of the links are not functional.

The Legend Of Random was a wordpress blog by `R4ndom`, a hacker and reverse engineer who shared his insights, challenges, tools and tutorials.

## why a static copy?

The wordpress blog got infected with malware at some point because of the lack of wordpress updates, and the author abandonned the project.

## notes

The site code is a big mess because of the wordpress templates code and because of the infection. Cleanup pull requests welcome. Please make atomic changes and separate pull requests.
